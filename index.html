    Hi! My name is Kaosiso Nwakile (my friends call me KC) and I am 15 years
    old, entering my Junior year in high school this September. I loveee
    listening to music, especially with my trusty AirPods; it allows me to be in
    my own, personal world. Having some time and space to myself is really
    important to me because I have a big family: five siblings(we're all close
    in age) and two parents. Our household can get a bit chaotic at times, so
    you can see why I enjoy having my "moments of seclusion". I'm still in the
    process of discovering myself and gaining the experiences I need to blossom,
    and this webpage is a part of that process. That being said, you should
    check out my website, explore and enjoy!
